            <p>
                My goal is to make an immediate impact in the business world and ameliorate my already
                profound
                knowledge of financials and technology to become an invaluable asset to a highly prestigious
                organisation. Despite being relatively new to the professional job market, my resolve and
                passion is
            undeniable. <br />

                    I began undertaking studies of computer coding in my free time whilst completing a Bachelor
                    of
                    Business Degree at Monash University which clearly highlights my desire to succeed through
                    hard
                    work
                    and dedication. I have worked various part time jobs since I was thirteen which has allowed
                    me
                    to
                    develop crucial interpersonal skills that make me suitable for any workplace environment.
            <br />

                        I have a strong skill set in mathematics and problem solving coupled with an innate desire
                        to
                        learn
                        from industry professionals. I am incredibly determined to ensure that I make the right
                        decisions
                        when entering into a professional position and thus will do whatever it takes to start my
                        career
                        on
                        the right foot.
